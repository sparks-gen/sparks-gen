Why do I have the urge to fill this in like a CV?
* Bachelor's in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology
* PhD in Human Genetics
* Wrote a program for PhD that will be published here
* Too much imposter syndrome for any of my other repositories to be public

Interests include:
* Gaming (mainly RPGs, Assassin's Creed is my favourite)
* Reading
* Pretty much anything fantasy related
* Having more hobbies than I can keep up with
